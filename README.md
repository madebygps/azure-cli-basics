## What's the advantage of using an Azure command-line tool?

Azure runs on automation. Every action inside the portal translates to code being executed to read, create, modify, or delete resources. Azure command-line tools automate routine operations, standardize database failovers, and pull data that provide powerful insight. 

## Chose the right Azure Command Line Tool

 You have two options when it comes to Azure command-lines: Azure CLI and Azure Powershell. Both are cross-platform, installable on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The most significant difference is that Azure CLI runs in Windows PowerShell, Cmd, Bash, and Unix shells. Azure Powershell requieres Windows PowerShell or Powershell to run. Choose the tool that uses your experience and shortens your learning curve but use a different tool when it makes sense.

## How to install the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is available to install in Windows, macOS and Linux environments. It can also be run in a Docker container and Azure Cloud Shell. I personally use Azure CLI in Ubuntu on [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Pick whatever option is best for you.
